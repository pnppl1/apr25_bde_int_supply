We walked into someone's home with the code for front door of apt complex, then front door to apartment.  It was someone's home. We scared them and they felt threatened henceforth threatened us.  In a town near our home in NY a person was shot and killed for going up the wrong driveway!  This could have been a dangerous situation and a major legal situation for VRBO.  We could only stay 1 night instead of 2 as the only hotel we could book at late notice was dirty and uncomfortable.  So a special family weekend, my Daughter's college graduation, was irrevocably changed by your irresponsibility.  To not offer any compensation will just prove your poor",2025-05-07,1

The day before we were to arrive, VRBO canceled the reservation citing that the homeowner “misscheduled” the date. This is completely unacceptable and clearly a case of the homeowner getting a better last minute deal from another renter. Dealing with VRBO to get refunded has been a nightmare. A last minute lower level hotel reservation for the same dates is $1000 more than what she paid VRBO. I highly recommend that no one use this service or rent from this property owner.

The pictures they allow on their site looks nothing like the property once you get there. Then when you try to get your money back because of false advertisement there is no help through this site.. Here is a review from a Villa in Bali called Villa Belize that we had the worst experience with and Vrbo is doing nothing!Photos are fixed to make you believe you are staying in such a luxury environment. My party reserved this place for a trip during one of the most humid times of the year in Bali. Every day we had to call the host because the air conditioning units were not working. You basically felt like you were sleeping outside.. Speaking of sleeping outside, photos doesn't show that pretty much all bathrooms except 1 is open concept so there is exposure to the outside.. The only bathroom that doesn't have exposure to the outside has the toilet, shower and sink right next to each other in this very small area.. This is the bathroom they show, but what's not shown is once you take a shower the whole bathroom gets very wet and takes a full day to dry, so you can't have your stuff out in the bathroom... The window in their also doesnt close completly which is a way for pest to get in.. Moving on to the rooms, the gaps between the doors are large enough for any pest to get in so every night we had to fight off some type of pest... Mainly little lizards, mosquitos, hugh  roaches.. I know Bali is the climax for these types of pest and I dont mind them on the outside, however there was easy access to the inside. This was supposed to be a enjoyable trip for a wedding we was attending and my birthday.. I ended up having to move out on the second day in the middle of the night due to pest in my room. We brought this attention to the house manager, who was nice to respond promptly and was willing to work with us stating we would get our money back. The stipulations was that the other two people in my party would find other lodging as well. We all ended up having to readjust and pay for lodging elsewhere spending additional money. However, we still are struggling to get our money back from the owner after several attempts and sending everything requested to VRBO who also is not very helpful in standing by their customers and investigating more.. Im in Bali often and have lodge at various places, which have been awesome. I must say this has been the worst experience I've ever had in Bali and hope no one else have to experience what we have.. Pictures im attaching will be all the gaps in doors and open spaces in room and bathroom.. Please don't go by the pictures posted by the owner as you will be very disappointed once you arrive and see you have been mislead! Pictures shown by the owner are very misleading and villa is not worth the money paid!",2025-04-14,1
Kimberly Anthony,US,1,I am done using vrbo,"I am done using vrbo. I made a reservation the end of 2024 for a beach house Augusta 2025 on Lake Huron. I had family coming in from Arkansas. The beach houses around here need to be rented a year in advance. Few weeks after I rented the house, they emailed me and canceled. They said it was because I had done something wrong. WhenI pressed the issue, wanting to know what it was I did wrong. They said it wasn't me.It was a host. The major problem was  it was too late to rent a beach house for such a large family.We decided to have the gathering in arkansas for my nephew's 40rh birthday. I rented a place a few months ago in Hot Springs. Arkansas for everyone. The night before I was to leave, I decided to go on the site. I was concerned because I had not received an email giving me information on how to get into the property. I go on the site and find out that my reservation was canceled the very next day. They did not send me an email, a text or anything. When I called them on it, they said, I canceled it. At this point I was a little bit upset and told them I needed proof of me canceling the reservation. They put me on, hold for 10 minutes and came back and said, no, it was not me.It was the owner. When I questioned, why was I not notified and explained I was not going on the vrbo every day to see if my reservation had been canceled or not, they had no explanation.No explanation no compensation and I have family coming in 24hr fom different parts of America to stay in hot springs  Arkansas and I have no place for them.Airbnb, saved me.

Miss Moxie,US,1,VRBO service is now sketchy,"VRBO has been fine in the past. However they are not paying attention to the listings now, even when notified. There is a property for rent that is listed twice under different hosts and for different prices - EXACT SAME PHOTOS bc it’s the same property. EVEN WORSE, the calendars are NOT synched for booking, so we accidentally booked it twice thinking it didn’t go through the first time. Long story short, 4 days and many hours on the phone, I finally said I will not end this conversation until you REFUND MY MONEY RIGHT NOW. They had admitted the owners/hosts were not supposed to list the same property and would address it. I checked today, 4 weeks later, the issue is still there. Two prices, two different calendars, same property. When I called and gave them the case #, which is a joke, you have to explain it all over anyway every time, I spent 45 minutes getting the same run around of ""sure let me escalate this, sounds like the problem is with the hosts however  …” Good luck everyone, it’s hard to find integrity these days.

Kristy Gardner,CA,1,HAD TO SLEEP IN RENTAL VAN WITH FAMILY OF 6,"Our flight was coming in to Miami quite late on the first of two nights we booked at this property.  We informed the property at time of booking that we would need after hours check in.  The property was very difficult to get in touch with.  We finally got them on the phone during a layover on our flight down.  They assured us we would be receiving after hours access information shortly and there was nothing to worry about.  landing in Miami we still had no information.  We couldn't get a hold of anyone from the property. We decided to start the long drive down to the property from Miami in hopes there would be some sort of security guard or emergency number on the office door and we would be able to gain access to our suite. No emergency number, no security gate like other properties in the area we have stayed at.  We contacted a customer service rep from VRBO.  He was not very helpful.  We tried to explain our situation multiple times before he understood what was going on.  He assured us that a manager would be calling us back immediately with a solution for us for the night. Nobody called us back. By this time we are exhausted and have no choice but for our family of six with four children between 4-15 years old to try to sleep in our rental van.  In the morning attempting to sleep in the parking lot the office opened.  The staff member Had the nerve to say not to worry we would not be charged for first night.

Hope Jackson,US,1,Do not use this website.. You don't get what you see and will not get your money back!,"Do not use this website... The pictures they allow on their site looks nothing like the property once you get there. Then when you try to get your money back because of false advertisement there is no help through this site.. Here is a review from a Villa in Bali called Villa Belize that we had the worst experience with and Vrbo is doing nothing!Photos are fixed to make you believe you are staying in such a luxury environment. My party reserved this place for a trip during one of the most humid times of the year in Bali. Every day we had to call the host because the air conditioning units were not working. You basically felt like you were sleeping outside.. Speaking of sleeping outside, photos doesn't show that pretty much all bathrooms except 1 is open concept so there is exposure to the outside.. The only bathroom that doesn't have exposure to the outside has the toilet, shower and sink right next to each other in this very small area.. This is the bathroom they show, but what's not shown is once you take a shower the whole bathroom gets very wet and takes a full day to dry, so you can't have your stuff out in the bathroom... The window in their also doesnt close completly which is a way for pest to get in.. Moving on to the rooms, the gaps between the doors are large enough for any pest to get in so every night we had to fight off some type of pest... Mainly little lizards, mosquitos, hugh  roaches.. I know Bali is the climax for these types of pest and I dont mind them on the outside, however there was easy access to the inside. This was supposed to be a enjoyable trip for a wedding we was attending and my birthday.. I ended up having to move out on the second day in the middle of the night due to pest in my room. We brought this attention to the house manager, who was nice to respond promptly and was willing to work with us stating we would get our money back. The stipulations was that the other two people in my party would find other lodging as well. We all ended up having to readjust and pay for lodging elsewhere spending additional money. However, we still are struggling to get our money back from the owner after several attempts and sending everything requested to VRBO who also is not very helpful in standing by their customers and investigating more.. Im in Bali often and have lodge at various places, which have been awesome. I must say this has been the worst experience I've ever had in Bali and hope no one else have to experience what we have.. Pictures im attaching will be all the gaps in doors and open spaces in room and bathroom.. Please don't go by the pictures posted by the owner as you will be very disappointed once you arrive and see you have been mislead! Pictures shown by the owner are very misleading and villa is not worth the money paid!",2025-04-14,1

We decided to start the long drive down to the property from Miami in hopes there would be some sort of security guard or emergency number on the office door and we would be able to gain access to our suite. No emergency number, no security gate like other properties in the area we have stayed at.  We contacted a customer service rep from VRBO.  He was not very helpful.  We tried to explain our situation multiple times before he understood what was going on.  He assured us that a manager would be calling us back immediately with a solution for us for the night. Nobody called us back. By this time we are exhausted and have no choice but for our family of six with four children between 4-15 years old to try to sleep in our rental van.  In the morning attempting to sleep in the parking lot the office opened.  The staff member Had the nerve to say not to worry we would not be charged for first night.  VRBO still HASNT CONTACTED US",2025-04-18,1
Sanjeev Kumar,ID,1,I wish I had read these reviews before…,"I wish I had read these reviews before using VRBO. I booked a room and it was $207.All went well and then later the money advertised was in USD and  then converted and charged in AUD. Which I think is a rip off because it was nowhere mentioned or made clear about this. And there is no way of contacting them. So if u want ro save your money and stress for any after sales issue, try to book directly with hotel, I think they would be better in helping.",2025-04-23,1
Hope Jackson,US,1,Do not use this website.. You don't get what you see and will not get your money back!,"Do not use this website... The pictures they allow on their site looks nothing like the property once you get there. Then when you try to get your money back because of false advertisement there is no help through this site.. Here is a review from a Villa in Bali called Villa Belize that we had the worst experience with and Vrbo is doing nothing!Photos are fixed to make you believe you are staying in such a luxury environment. My party reserved this place for a trip during one of the most humid times of the year in Bali. Every day we had to call the host because the air conditioning units were not working. You basically felt like you were sleeping outside.. Speaking of sleeping outside, photos doesn't show that pretty much all bathrooms except 1 is open concept so there is exposure to the outside.. The only bathroom that doesn't have exposure to the outside has the toilet, shower and sink right next to each other in this very small area.. This is the bathroom they show, but what's not shown is once you take a shower the whole bathroom gets very wet and takes a full day to dry, so you can't have your stuff out in the bathroom... The window in their also doesnt close completly which is a way for pest to get in.. Moving on to the rooms, the gaps between the doors are large enough for any pest to get in so every night we had to fight off some type of pest... Mainly little lizards, mosquitos, hugh  roaches.. I know Bali is the climax for these types of pest and I dont mind them on the outside, however there was easy access to the inside. This was supposed to be a enjoyable trip for a wedding we was attending and my birthday.. I ended up having to move out on the second day in the middle of the night due to pest in my room. We brought this attention to the house manager, who was nice to respond promptly and was willing to work with us stating we would get our money back. The stipulations was that the other two people in my party would find other lodging as well. We all ended up having to readjust and pay for lodging elsewhere spending additional money. However, we still are struggling to get our money back from the owner after several attempts and sending everything requested to VRBO who also is not very helpful in standing by their customers and investigating more.. Im in Bali often and have lodge at various places, which have been awesome. I must say this has been the worst experience I've ever had in Bali and hope no one else have to experience what we have.. Pictures im attaching will be all the gaps in doors and open spaces in room and bathroom.. Please don't go by the pictures posted by the owner as you will be very disappointed once you arrive and see you have been mislead! Pictures shown by the owner are very misleading and villa is not worth the money paid!",2025-04-14,1
Kimberly Anthony,US,1,I am done using vrbo,"I am done using vrbo. I made a reservation the end of 2024 for a beach house Augusta 2025 on Lake Huron. I had family coming in from Arkansas. The beach houses around here need to be rented a year in advance. Few weeks after I rented the house, they emailed me and canceled. They said it was because I had done something wrong. WhenI pressed the issue, wanting to know what it was I did wrong. They said it wasn't me.It was a host. The major problem was  it was too late to rent a beach house for such a large family.We decided to have the gathering in arkansas for my nephew's 40rh birthday. I rented a place a few months ago in Hot Springs. Arkansas for everyone. The night before I was to leave, I decided to go on the site. I was concerned because I had not received an email giving me information on how to get into the property. I go on the site and find out that my reservation was canceled the very next day. They did not send me an email, a text or anything. When I called them on it, they said, I canceled it. At this point I was a little bit upset and told them I needed proof of me canceling the reservation. They put me on, hold for 10 minutes and came back and said, no, it was not me.It was the owner. When I questioned, why was I not notified and explained I was not going on the vrbo every day to see if my reservation had been canceled or not, they had no explanation.No explanation no compensation and I have family coming in 24hr fom different parts of America to stay in hot springs  Arkansas and I have no place for them.Airbnb, saved me. Vrbo never again, never again shame on me for letting them burn me two times.",2025-05-07,1
Miss Moxie,US,1,VRBO service is now sketchy,"VRBO has been fine in the past. However they are not paying attention to the listings now, even when notified. There is a property for rent that is listed twice under different hosts and for different prices - EXACT SAME PHOTOS bc it’s the same property. EVEN WORSE, the calendars are NOT synched for booking, so we accidentally booked it twice thinking it didn’t go through the first time. Long story short, 4 days and many hours on the phone, I finally said I will not end this conversation until you REFUND MY MONEY RIGHT NOW. They had admitted the owners/hosts were not supposed to list the same property and would address it. I checked today, 4 weeks later, the issue is still there. Two prices, two different calendars, same property. When I called and gave them the case #, which is a joke, you have to explain it all over anyway every time, I spent 45 minutes getting the same run around of ""sure let me escalate this, sounds like the problem is with the hosts however  …” Good luck everyone, it’s hard to find integrity these days. We will find another service to book through.",2025-05-11,1

Ritesh Raj Singh,US,1,Pathetic Experience,"I had a deeply frustrating and disappointing experience with Priceline that disrupted a major life event and left me stranded with my family in the middle of the night.I booked a prepaid, non-refundable car rental through Priceline (Confirmation #: 780-975-535-16) for pickup at Atlanta Airport on May 3rd at 1:00 AM, ahead of my graduation from Georgia Tech. I was traveling with my wife and two kids and needed to be at the ceremony early in the morning.Despite having a confirmed reservation, no car was available upon arrival. I contacted Priceline support, and they assured me the reservation would be canceled, that a refund would be issued, and that expenses for Lyft/Uber and the inconvenience would be reimbursed. We were stranded at the airport and had to book a hotel and use Lyft—all at my own expense.After waiting 36 hours, I returned to the airport and booked a new reservation, but the rental company mistakenly applied the pickup to the original reservation. Priceline then denied the refund, claiming the original reservation was used, even though I had no vehicle for 36 hours.To make matters worse, Priceline has refused to issue a meaningful refund, despite the fact that I had no car for a significant portion of the reservation. Every time I call, I'm told that the best they can offer is a 10% coupon for a future booking which is completely unacceptable given the circumstances. This doesn’t even begin to address the inconvenience, added expenses, or the disruption caused on a milestone day for my family.This was not my fault, yet I’ve been left with the burden of extra costs, lost time, and poor service—with no accountability from Priceline. The handling of this situation was misleading, inconsistent, and completely unfair. I expected better from a major travel service.I do not recommend using Priceline for car rentals—if anything goes wrong, you're on your own.",2025-05-02,0

Ritesh Raj Singh,US,1,Pathetic Experience,"I had a deeply frustrating and disappointing experience with Priceline that disrupted a major life event and left me stranded with my family in the middle of the night.I booked a prepaid, non-refundable car rental through Priceline (Confirmation #: 780-975-535-16) for pickup at Atlanta Airport on May 3rd at 1:00 AM, ahead of my graduation from Georgia Tech. I was traveling with my wife and two kids and needed to be at the ceremony early in the morning.Despite having a confirmed reservation, no car was available upon arrival. I contacted Priceline support, and they assured me the reservation would be canceled, that a refund would be issued, and that expenses for Lyft/Uber and the inconvenience would be reimbursed. We were stranded at the airport and had to book a hotel and use Lyft—all at my own expense.After waiting 36 hours, I returned to the airport and booked a new reservation, but the rental company mistakenly applied the pickup to the original reservation. Priceline then denied the refund, claiming the original reservation was used, even though I had no vehicle for 36 hours.To make matters worse, Priceline has refused to issue a meaningful refund, despite the fact that I had no car for a significant portion of the reservation. Every time I call, I'm told that the best they can offer is a 10% coupon for a future booking which is completely unacceptable given the circumstances. This doesn’t even begin to address the inconvenience, added expenses, or the disruption caused on a milestone day for my family.This was not my fault, yet I’ve been left with the burden of extra costs, lost time, and poor service—with no accountability from Priceline. The handling of this situation was misleading, inconsistent, and completely unfair. I expected better from a major travel service.I do not recommend using Priceline for car rentals—if anything goes wrong, you're on your own.",2025-05-02,0

Anonymous,US,1,This company is a scam and there is no…,"This company is a scam and there is no one in the US that you can speak with regarding any issues. I paid for a parking spot that included a free shuttle to and from the airport. The shuttle never came to take me to the airport, I almost missed my plane. I went to the closest hotel and begged their shuttle to take me to the airport, which they did. I made the complaint to Way.com and they stated because I could not show them a receipt for an Uber, there was nothing they could do. On the way back from the airport, I had to wait 2 hours for a shuttle that supposedly runs every 30 minutes. Again, I spoke with a rep from Way.com WHILE waiting for a shuttle that had not come for over an hour...the rep stated the shuttle was there and it was not. They sent me a photo of the shuttle that I was supposed to get picked up by and it was the wrong shuttle bus that they sent me a picture of. Then they sent me $25 worth of coupons to used for another parking reservation. I went online and tried to use the coupon they emailed me for another reservation and not only did they NOT accept the coupon THEY emailed me, they charged me full price for a parking reservation that I did not want! I am now waiting on a refund that will not come for 7-10 business days even though it was immediately taken out of my account.

My confirmation number didn’t work when I needed it most, and there was zero customer support available to help.The app looks convenient on the surface, but when you're standing at the airport trying to figure out how to get to your car, it completely fails.

Mercy Nnadi,US,1,Terrible experience!! Do not book with them,"I booked a flight for my family through CheapFareGuru, and it was a complete nightmare. The airline changed our flight time, so I called CheapFareGuru to rebook us to a better time. Instead of assisting with the rebooking, I ended up having to purchase new tickets for all three of us. I spoke to multiple agents, and not once did they mention any booking fees or processing fee for the previous flight. They assured me that I would receive a Full refund for the previous flight, but that never happened. They said booking fees was charged.The entire process was extremely stressful, causing me unnecessary anxiety. Going back and forth with them was a hassle, and in the end, it was just a terrible experience. I will never use CheapFareGuru again and highly recommend avoiding them if you want peace of mind",2025-04-02,0

NANA,US,1,75 dollars caution,I received an email by cheapfare Guru stating that my flight times has been changed and I need to confirm the email.  I confirmed the email to the changes. I was not informed that I was going to be charged 75 dollars for the changed that was not my fault but the airline. I spoke to a representative who informed me of the company rules if such changes occurs. This is my first time using this company and i bought 2 tickets.

After I made a reservation and paid for my e-ticket, my credit card was unexpectedly charged an additional $40. When I contacted their representative, I was told it was related to a pending transaction with the carrier and that I might receive a refund later.When I refused to accept this unexplained charge, they suddenly offered to cancel my reservation—and then, to my surprise, charged me another $75 for the cancellation.Their advertised online prices are misleading.

Robert,US,1,Fraudulent Change Fee When Airline Changes Schedule,"JetBlue changed the flight schedule for our departure flight from Jacksonville to New York to meet our international connection.  JetBlue and Royal Air Maroc both notified me of the change directly and did not mention a need to re-issue the ticket.  I received an e-mail from AirTkt.com asking me to confirm the time change for the flight, to which I responded.  AirTkt then charged me $25 per ticket to ""reissue"" the confirmed tickets. The ticket was issued as a through ticket on Royal Air Maroc ticket stock, and JetBlue was perfectly prepared to honor the original ticket without re-issue.  In other words, AirTkt baited me into authorizing an unnecessary re-issue with their e-mail stating that ""If you will not reply to the email you may miss your flight.""  The email did not mention a fee involved with confirming that I was aware that the airline had changed the flight time.   Finally, AirTkt completed the fraud by claiming that they needed to re-issue the tickets, but no actual re-issue was done.  The ticket numbers remain exactly the same as when first issued in December.  So, AirTkt charged me for something that not only was not ""required"", but no service was actually provided for the payment extracted.  UPDATE:  AirTkt kept responding to my e-mail with boilerplate pablum about their policies and nonsense word salads.  This morning  I was informed that they would be ""making an exception"" and refunding my $50.  So, to prospective buyers, I say that you can, in fact, get a good deal on business class tickets from AirTkt, but remember that you are dealing with a consolidator, not a regular travel agency.  Read and understand what you are buying.  Buy separate travel insurance from a third party to cover the price of your non-refundable, non-changeable tickets in the event of an emergency cancellation.  Realize that until you check in for your flight the airline can do nothing with your ticket, except maybe give you seat assignments.  After you check in, the reverse is true.  AirTkt is completely out of the picture.  BUT, as this episode has demonstrated, AirTkt is a sleazy outfit that will try to game you for unearned fees on the back end.  There are other reliable consolidators out there:  Buy from one of them.  If you buy a ticket from AirTkt, my advice is to follow up on the airline's web site to ensure that the airline has the reservation and then never communicate with AirTkt again about that reservation.

And it was NON refundable.I reported this and they did give around 200 dollars back.Now we have come home from the hotel.

No breakfast etc.It wasn't clean when we got there.And also checked the price directly from the hotel which was 64british pounds pr night.Never buy anything from this site.

Bruce Richardson,US,1,Predatory 3rd party Priceline.com service,"The 3rd party service, GuestReservations.com I am told by an IHG hotel is owned by priceline.com.  This said, Priceline.com customer service has no record of reservations made on this site.  The site's predatory practices should have you blocking guest reservations.com along with priceline.com sites because as the following example will show, they are clearly a sleazy and predatory organization.  Now let me explain why.  After using them twice, I made a 3rd reservation in 3 weeks on guestreservations.com that needed adjusting.  The hotel told me that they were locked out of the reservation and that any changes had to be done by the third party. I waited for over 1.5 hours on hold with guestreservations.com, listening to the most annoying music loop followed by a repeating message telling me that my call would be answered in the order that it was received.  I finally hung up, understanding that they were never going to answer the call. The hotel advised that since they were locked out they had no choice but to recreate the reservation and that I would need to get hold of guestreservations.com at some point soon to cancel the incorrect upcoming reservation flat.  They advise that upon receiving my request that the 3rd party should contact the hotel to verify and then should process the cancellation flat.  I finally got a hold of the website's customer disservice dept the following day, speaking to somebody clearly located in India.  She advised that their policies allowed no option other than to process a cancellation retaining roughly 80% of what was paid.  She was immovable on this subject, continuously repeating the position.  I then explained what my policy would be... To never use their service again and to educate others in advance to avoid being taken advantage of in a similar fashion.  She didn't care.  I told her to feel free to diary my information and check back in one month, 6 months and a year to confirm what their lack of customer service has cost them.    Ironically, I found their pricing is also higher than what I have been offered by the hotel the last few times that I have compared rates for curiosity's sake.  Anyone that chooses to still use them, has been warned and does so at their own peril. I hope this helps save others from being taken advantage of in a similar way.  Best of luck!",2025-05-12,1

Bruce Richardson,US,1,Predatory 3rd party Priceline.com service,"The 3rd party service, GuestReservations.com I am told by an IHG hotel is owned by priceline.com.  This said, Priceline.com customer service has no record of reservations made on this site.  The site's predatory practices should have you blocking guest reservations.com along with priceline.com sites because as the following example will show, they are clearly a sleazy and predatory organization.  Now let me explain why.  After using them twice, I made a 3rd reservation in 3 weeks on guestreservations.com that needed adjusting.  The hotel told me that they were locked out of the reservation and that any changes had to be done by the third party. I waited for over 1.5 hours on hold with guestreservations.com, listening to the most annoying music loop followed by a repeating message telling me that my call would be answered in the order that it was received.  I finally hung up, understanding that they were never going to answer the call. The hotel advised that since they were locked out they had no choice but to recreate the reservation and that I would need to get hold of guestreservations.com at some point soon to cancel the incorrect upcoming reservation flat.  They advise that upon receiving my request that the 3rd party should contact the hotel to verify and then should process the cancellation flat.  I finally got a hold of the website's customer disservice dept the following day, speaking to somebody clearly located in India.  She advised that their policies allowed no option other than to process a cancellation retaining roughly 80% of what was paid.  She was immovable on this subject, continuously repeating the position.  I then explained what my policy would be... To never use their service again and to educate others in advance to avoid being taken advantage of in a similar fashion.  She didn't care.  I told her to feel free to diary my information and check back in one month, 6 months and a year to confirm what their lack of customer service has cost them.    Ironically, I found their pricing is also higher than what I have been offered by the hotel the last few times that I have compared rates for curiosity's sake.  Anyone that chooses to still use them, has been warned and does so at their own peril. I hope this helps save others from being taken advantage of in a similar way.  Best of luck!",2025-05-12,1

Linda Heigham,US,1,BEWARE,"BEWARE! I was flying out on JetBlue, which is in the C terminal. They do not tell you the ONLY place they dump you is at terminal A. If you are not aware of the Orlando airport, it took me 25 minutes to run across the airport and then waited for a train to get me to my gate.  I am 70 years old and the reason I wanted to park outside the airport was to have as little stress as possible. Their van has a broken window and a piece of plastic replaced the window. Not very professional. When I picked up my car they had adjusted my seat both back and seat were adjusted, the rear view mirror was changed, my lights that are on automatic was off, my interior lights were shut off so when opening the door at midnight I could not see what I was doing and I my dash has been changed so I am needing to look in my manual to figure out how to correct their changes. The wait at the end of a long road for the pickup was not a comfortable situation. Go elsewhere if you want a good experience.",2025-04-18,1
Taimoor Siddiqui,CA,1,Beware of this scam,"Beware of this scam. The company is very misleading with its pricing. At first, they don’t make it clear that there are additional charges to be paid when picking up the car. Once you make the booking, you receive an invoice that shows a significant amount owed at the lot.They use terms like “Pay Now,” “Pay at Lot,” and “Grand Total” in a way that suggests you’re getting a better deal by paying upfront. However, the reality is that you’re required to pay both now and again at the lot—a highly deceptive tactic. The “Grand Total” only reflects the online payment and does not include what’s due at the lot, further adding to the confusion.When I called customer service for clarification, the experience was terrible. I asked for the representative’s name; initially, he refused to give it and later said it was ""Diego,"" which I doubt is even accurate.Wish I could give 0 stars.",2025-04-15,1
Andreas Bieger,US,2,Hidden subscription plan,Drop off to the airport went well however for pickup we had to wait almost one hour.With booking the parking it seems that I signed up for a subscription plan that I was not aware of. I did not get any explanation how this happened.,2025-04-09,1
Jan Jurnecka,US,1,ripped off for an extra day,"things went well at Crown Plaza Phoenix when I parked.  however, upon return at 11:30pm, a couple of hours past my estimated time (late flight), but 10 hours before the end of the 24 hour period paid for (I arrived at 9am), I was charged for another full day to get out of the lot.  I first talked with the desk, who said they don't run the lot.  I attempted to call the number at the checkout gate...no answer.  I've now talked with the garage operator and Global, who both tell me that since I arrived past my ""reserved"" time, I'm out of luck.  I've never had this happen with any other parking vendor...I don't plan to use this company in the future.",2025-04-07,1
KBH,US,1,Just pay to park at the airport,"Hampton Inn & Suites had the warmest desk staff who gave me clear parking and shuttle information on my Tuesday morning arrival. I parked my car and was promptly greeted by the shuttle driver and taken to Southwest departures. I left assured I would have an equally easy experience when I returned. Not so.A deeply unfriendly staff person took my call for the shuttle when I returned late Saturday night. I was coldly told that I would be waiting at least 45 minutes and could call back around that time to get an ETA. After a 6 hour flight I really just wanted to get to my car and go home.I parked at Hampton in an attempt to spend less than I do parking at Harry Reid.

Sara Jeekao,US,1,Disappointing Experience with Outdoorsy…,"Disappointing Experience with Outdoorsy and PayPal Payment Option.I rented an RV van through Outdoorsy for a holiday trip and decided to use the 0% interest payment option through PayPal, allowing me to pay off the rental in four installments. To set it up, I linked my credit card to my PayPal account, expecting a smooth transaction. However, I was unexpectedly charged interest on my credit card.When I contacted Outdoorsy for assistance, I received no support. They simply directed me to PayPal, stating they received the payment from PayPal and that the issue was not theirs to resolve. They also mentioned that other customers had experienced the same issue with this payment offer. If that's the case, why is Outdoorsy still offering a payment option with these known issues?While I understand that PayPal may be at fault, Outdoorsy is the one offering this payment option on their platform. As such, they should have taken more responsibility in resolving the problem. Instead, they passed me off to PayPal, leaving me frustrated and without any resolution.Additionally, Outdoorsy should have made it clear on their platform that customers choosing this payment option must first be approved by PayPal. When I selected the payment plan, the process appeared seamless. But when I called PayPal, they asked if I had received an approval email. I had received an email authorizing the payment to Outdoorsy, Inc., but it turns out this was not the approval email they meant.It’s incredibly disappointing that Outdoorsy, a company that provides services to customers, showed no interest in addressing my concerns once they had received their payment. The lack of customer service and accountability is unacceptable.

Sara Jeekao,US,1,Disappointing Experience with Outdoorsy…,"Disappointing Experience with Outdoorsy and PayPal Payment Option.I rented an RV van through Outdoorsy for a holiday trip and decided to use the 0% interest payment option through PayPal, allowing me to pay off the rental in four installments. To set it up, I linked my credit card to my PayPal account, expecting a smooth transaction. However, I was unexpectedly charged interest on my credit card.When I contacted Outdoorsy for assistance, I received no support. They simply directed me to PayPal, stating they received the payment from PayPal and that the issue was not theirs to resolve. They also mentioned that other customers had experienced the same issue with this payment offer. If that's the case, why is Outdoorsy still offering a payment option with these known issues?While I understand that PayPal may be at fault, Outdoorsy is the one offering this payment option on their platform. As such, they should have taken more responsibility in resolving the problem. Instead, they passed me off to PayPal, leaving me frustrated and without any resolution.Additionally, Outdoorsy should have made it clear on their platform that customers choosing this payment option must first be approved by PayPal. When I selected the payment plan, the process appeared seamless. But when I called PayPal, they asked if I had received an approval email. I had received an email authorizing the payment to Outdoorsy, Inc., but it turns out this was not the approval email they meant.It’s incredibly disappointing that Outdoorsy, a company that provides services to customers, showed no interest in addressing my concerns once they had received their payment.

Jerry Wallace Brinson,US,1,Horrible London Hotel Booking,"As part of our London/Paris trip, GVV booked us into the Zedwell Underground Tottenham Road hotel in London.  This hotel was absolutely the worst hotel experience our group has ever had when traveling.  Rooms are four/five levels below ground floor, with no windows, no pictures on the walls, no closet and no space to accommodate luggage, no hair dryers, no nightstands or lamps, no chairs or desk, no TV or telephone, no safe, refrigerator, no carpeting.The ""bed"" was a basically a mattress on the floor with filthy bedding.The room was not serviced our entire stay with the exception of two clean bath towels each day (no washcloths or hand towels). We had to specially request that they replenish the toilet paper.Because there were no hair dryers or clothes irons in the room, we were forced to go up to another floor to use communal hair dryers and irons in a ""beauty/ironing room"".The bathroom had a shower that left water all over the bathroom floor and an extremely tiny sink. No tissues or other amenities that one might expect in a four star hotel. The shower wall was moldy and unclean with hair on the walls. One morning we had no water. The plumbing was extremely noisy with various sounds during the night. Although this hotel boasted that the rooms were soundproof, noise from the subway trains were heard constantly throughout the night.But perhaps the most concerning issue to my party was the feeling that our safety and health were at risk by staying in this facility. The subterranean floors including the reception area in this hotel all reeked of sewage and stale air. In the event of a fire, there would be no way to escape. One of our party became ill during our stay and had to have EMS from the NHS come to evaluate her and transport her to the hospital. The EMS stated that the air in the hotel was very unhealthy due to no circulation and that it would be impossible to evacuate a patient by stretcher if necessary. Fortunately, the ill member of our party was able to walk out. It is possible that the unhealthy conditions in the hotel contributed to her illness. Three of the remaining members of our party ended up with severe head colds.GVV refused to compensate us in any way for this disgusting hotel.  Our travel voucher said that our stay included an “English breakfast” but the hotel had no food services.  GVV did refund us $10 per day per person for the missing breakfasts, but this amount is quite laughable to think that one could eat breakfast in London for $10 (7£).  GVV insisted that the hotel delivered on their online description.  Only if one considered a “curated playlist” to be constant subway train noises and “soothing scents” to be reeking sewage.Because of this horrible hotel experience, I cannot be comfortable ever using GVV again for travel and will definitely warn my friends from using them.  Their failure to offer us any compensation for this bad experience shows that they do not “Value” their customers, only their bottom line.In response to your response:It would still behoove your company’s reputation to offer monetary compensation for our unsatisfactory experience.  And I DO NOT mean in the form of a future travel credit, which is no more than you offer for all of your customers in the form of a $100 off pp travel voucher on any future trip.  I believe one of my co-travelers suggested that a $100 refund pp would be appropriate and acceptable to us.  But I guess you would rather receive a one star rating for your customer service.",2025-04-21,1

Two nights in each city is not enough time to absorb or get acclimated to the language, the culture, the currency, the food, the local custom, etc….  My head was on a swivel the entire week, anxiety was very much the order of the day for me as I tried to interpret road signs, find my train platform and make sure I had enough coins in my pocket to use the public toilets.

Rooms are four/five levels below ground floor, with no windows, no pictures on the walls, no closet and no space to accommodate luggage, no hair dryers, no nightstands or lamps, no chairs or desk, no TV or telephone, no safe, refrigerator, no carpeting.The ""bed"" was a basically a mattress on the floor with filthy bedding.The room was not serviced our entire stay with the exception of two clean bath towels each day (no washcloths or hand towels). We had to specially request that they replenish the toilet paper.Because there were no hair dryers or clothes irons in the room, we were forced to go up to another floor to use communal hair dryers and irons in a ""beauty/ironing room"".The bathroom had a shower that left water all over the bathroom floor and an extremely tiny sink. No tissues or other amenities that one might expect in a four star hotel. The shower wall was moldy and unclean with hair on the walls. One morning we had no water. The plumbing was extremely noisy with various sounds during the night. Although this hotel boasted that the rooms were soundproof, noise from the subway trains were heard constantly throughout the night.But perhaps the most concerning issue to my party was the feeling that our safety and health were at risk by staying in this facility. The subterranean floors including the reception area in this hotel all reeked of sewage and stale air. In the event of a fire, there would be no way to escape. One of our party became ill during our stay and had to have EMS from the NHS come to evaluate her and transport her to the hospital. The EMS stated that the air in the hotel was very unhealthy due to no circulation and that it would be impossible to evacuate a patient by stretcher if necessary. Fortunately, the ill member of our party was able to walk out. It is possible that the unhealthy conditions in the hotel contributed to her illness. Three of the remaining members of our party ended up with severe head colds.GVV refused to compensate us in any way for this disgusting hotel.  Our travel voucher said that our stay included an “English breakfast” but the hotel had no food services.  GVV did refund us $10 per day per person for the missing breakfasts, but this amount is quite laughable to think that one could eat breakfast in London for $10 (7£).  GVV insisted that the hotel delivered on their online description.  Only if one considered a “curated playlist” to be constant subway train noises and “soothing scents” to be reeking sewage.Because of this horrible hotel experience, I cannot be comfortable ever using GVV again for travel and will definitely warn my friends from using them.  Their failure to offer us any compensation for this bad experience shows that they do not “Value” their customers, only their bottom line.In response to your response:It would still behoove your company’s reputation to offer monetary compensation for our unsatisfactory experience.  And I DO NOT mean in the form of a future travel credit, which is no more than you offer for all of your customers in the form of a $100 off pp travel voucher on any future trip.  I believe one of my co-travelers suggested that a $100 refund pp would be appropriate and acceptable to us.  But I guess you would rather receive a one star rating for your customer service.",2025-04-21,1

Tour guides were very knowledgeable and did their best to keep us informed.Breakfast and dinner was less than ideal most of the time. Wish their was items we could choose from. Since we are paying for these meals in the cost of the trip it was really disappointing to not have good meals. Or what seemed to be the cheapest meals there were. On top of this there was no real time on lunch to really go explore food options. Having this be my first trip to Europe I was really disappointed in 90% of the food. Most of the time we were stuck in areas that were not air conditioned and very warm. Also, we were only allowed water unless we wanted to pay extra. Again since food is paid for in the cost of the trip we should have been allowed a drink of our choice.Also, I wasn't very happy with the hotel choices with the exception of the hotel in Paris. There was no air conditioning allowed in the hotels making for an uncomfortable sleeping arrangements.There wasn't enough time to truly have some free time to explore or just take in what we were seeing. Everything was rushed. Including walking. The pace should be slower so people don't feel like they are running a race. I expected there to be a lot of walking but what I didn't expect was to have to walk 10 minutes or more to get back to the buses. I don't understand why they could drop us off close to our venue but not pick us up close to our venue.Overall, it was a great trip. Got to see and do a lot but just not enough time to explore and see a bit of the culture and shop. There should be 2 1/2 hours at lunch to get to eat somewhere good and explore. An hour and a half isn't long enough.I really did enjoy our tour guides Charles and Mike by the end of the trip it felt like one big family!Thank you.",2025-04-25,0

Jennifer Shinn,US,5,"Thoughtfully Planned, Student-Centered Travel Experiences That Inspire","Traveling with EF Tours has been a truly rewarding experience for both my students and myself as a Group Leader. What stands out most is the level of organization, care, and thoughtful planning that goes into every part of the trip — from the pre-departure support to the on-the-ground experience. EF makes what could be an overwhelming process feel manageable and even fun, especially for busy educators like me.The professionalism and knowledge of our Tour Director and local guides brought the destinations to life in ways that went far beyond what students would experience as ordinary tourists. I also appreciated the variety in the itinerary — major cities, charming small towns, and incredible optional excursions that added unforgettable moments to our trip, like dining in the Tuscan countryside and visiting one of Italy’s oldest hilltop towns.EF also excels in their support behind the scenes. My Experience Specialist, Johanna, did a great job at keeping me organized, answering my many questions, and even going out of her way to help us add an extra chaperone last minute. That kind of service makes a huge difference for educators juggling a lot of responsibilities.If I had one piece of constructive feedback, it would be to continue finding ways to support first-time Group Leaders with clearer expectations during fast-paced moments on tour — but overall, EF has built an impressive system that balances structure with flexibility, and I’m so grateful for the experience.We’ve already sold out our next tour to Greece for 2026 and are excited to plan for 2027.

Museum after museum.  She is top ten in her class, and she could not remember what country a couple locations were located, because everything started to run together.  Madrid could have been left off. That would have allowed the girls to enjoy Rome and Paris a little more on their own with their chaperone's. It would have given them a little more free time which they wanted. A little more time to enjoy the city and see more things on their own (with chaperone's).  As a mother, i truly understand where they are coming from.  We understand this is an educational trip, BUT you can get education as well from exploring a city and enjoying the culture, sites, food, shops and sounds of the city. It would have felt a little more personal as well.  We get the museum exploration but there was a couple too many.Adding a little more site seeing and experiencing on their own in groups with their chaperone would have been very nice.

She knows nothing about me or my life but felt she could make harsh and untrue judgements on me. She advised I had lied on my post which is not correct. I had been advised by another member how to write my post as it was the first time I had to do this and I had very little time prior to going away. I had someone lined up to do the job but it fell through as they were returning home. She basically made it sound like my house was a dump and I did not look after my furbabies which is completely incorrect. My house may not have been perfect, but I only just moved back into my house after being out for a year due to water damage during storms. I had informed her of this but obviously she has no compassion. There was also a cyclone between the time I moved back to my house. I have major depression and severe anxiety and yet I still work full-time. Would be nice to have the money to be retired and sit in judgement of others. My furbabies are my world. To read the review she gave me after months of trying to determine (multiple visits to the vet) why my furbaby still had blood in her urine (I was told it was an ongoing UTI by the vets) and why she was losing weight. I found out whilst overseas that she had cancer, and I had to make the decision to have her put down. It is highly disappointing to find out the person I trusted with my house and furbabies turned out to be a very judgemental and not a compassionate person. Not sure how someone so judgemental can possibly be a good person to take care of your most treasured furbabies. I hope she takes a good look in the mirror and judges herself for her actions and lies.""",2025-04-04,1

David Adeleke,CA,1,I am extremely disappointed with…,"I am extremely disappointed with BudgetAir’s deceptive sales tactics and their complete lack of accountability after taking my money.I booked a flight through BudgetAir for over CAD $2000, specifically choosing their “Cancel for Any Reason” option based on written confirmation from their agent that I would receive 80% to 100% of my total flight cost as a refund if I needed to cancel. This assurance was given before payment and was the only reason I chose the higher-priced ticket.After booking, I was shocked to discover that the “refund” they now offer is less than half of what I paid. When I raised the issue, BudgetAir completely refused to take responsibility, despite having chat records where their agent guaranteed the refund percentage. They keep blaming a third-party provider (Hopper) and refuse to escalate the matter internally or provide any real support.This is classic bait-and-switch behavior—selling a high-priced service based on misleading promises, then walking away when the customer seeks help. They sell products they cannot explain, verify, or stand behind, leaving customers to chase third parties after payment.I am filing formal complaints with my bank, Canadian consumer protection authorities, and leaving public records on every platform I can find to warn other travelers.⚠️ Do not trust BudgetAir with your travel or your money. Their “Cancel for Any Reason” offer is misleading, and they will leave you stranded when it matters most.",2025-05-14,1

A Hewmun,US,1,RV Share is an absolute nightmare of a…,"RV Share is an absolute nightmare of a company—stay far away! I booked an RV on March 4th for a family trip, shelling out a ridiculous $1,600 for just 4 nights. I told them exactly where I was going, spent over a month studying the area and the RV, and made campground reservations to ensure everything was perfect. My family—kids included—was buzzing with excitement for what was supposed to be an unforgettable getaway.Then, on April 8th—ONE DAY before I was set to pick up the RV on April 9th—I got a notification that flipped my world upside down: the RV I booked and paid for over 30 days ago was canceled. No warning, no reason, just a gut punch out of nowhere. I was in the middle of packing when it hit, and I couldn’t believe it. The day before pickup? Are you kidding me?It gets worse. RV Share didn’t even have the decency to apologize. No “sorry,” no discount on another RV, no help finding an alternative—nothing. Just a smug, heartless “Screw you, too bad” vibe that left me stranded. I scrambled to contact them, but their customer service was a black hole: no answers, no support, just silence. They took my money and ran, leaving me with a canceled trip and a family to disappoint.The emotional toll was brutal. My kids were crushed—they’d been counting down the days, and I had to look them in the eyes and explain why we weren’t going. All that planning, all that excitement—wasted. It’s not just upsetting; it’s infuriating. RV Share didn’t care one bit about screwing us over.And here’s the real warning: this isn’t a fluke—it’s how they operate. Dig around online, and you’ll see this is common practice for RV Share. They lure you in with promises of a great trip, take your hard-earned cash, and then cancel at the last second with zero remorse. It’s predatory, plain and simple. People need to know what they’re signing up for with this sham of a company.Do NOT book with RV Share. Save your money, your time, and your sanity.

Bryan Taylor,US,1,Completely screwed me out of payment…,Completely screwed me out of payment from a rental. Customer tried to cancel within the 30 day cancellation window so I was owed the full payment (very unlikely to re-book the dates). Rep verified by phone the morning before I’d receive full payment. Then in the afternoon I received an email saying the customer “didn’t verify info for insurance” and so they were canceling the trip. Called and they’d do nothing for me despite the documentation that the customer wanted to cancel and was trying to get out of paying. Pretty obvious he exploited a loop hole. Horrible they won’t stand behind us.,2025-04-16,0
Curt Altarac,US,1,Beware of Hidden Fees and Poor Customer Service,"I attempted to rent an RV through RVshare, but after checkout I received an email informing me of several unexpected insurance fees—none of which were clearly disclosed upfront, and there was no way to opt out. I tried contacting customer service immediately, but no one answered. Days later, I finally spoke with someone who clearly had handled this type of complaint many times before. They walked me through the cancellation process—but still kept the “service fee” despite the misleading experience.I’ve rented RVs, homes, and more over the years, and this was by far the strangest and least transparent experience I’ve had. I ended up canceling and losing money, but I felt compelled to leave a review so others are aware. There are better, more honest local companies out there—do yourself a favor and avoid RVshare.",2025-04-16,0
A Hewmun,US,1,RV Share is an absolute nightmare of a…,"RV Share is an absolute nightmare of a company—stay far away! I booked an RV on March 4th for a family trip, shelling out a ridiculous $1,600 for just 4 nights. I told them exactly where I was going, spent over a month studying the area and the RV, and made campground reservations to ensure everything was perfect. My family—kids included—was buzzing with excitement for what was supposed to be an unforgettable getaway.Then, on April 8th—ONE DAY before I was set to pick up the RV on April 9th—I got a notification that flipped my world upside down: the RV I booked and paid for over 30 days ago was canceled. No warning, no reason, just a gut punch out of nowhere. I was in the middle of packing when it hit, and I couldn’t believe it. The day before pickup? Are you kidding me?It gets worse. RV Share didn’t even have the decency to apologize. No “sorry,” no discount on another RV, no help finding an alternative—nothing. Just a smug, heartless “Screw you, too bad” vibe that left me stranded. I scrambled to contact them, but their customer service was a black hole: no answers, no support, just silence. They took my money and ran, leaving me with a canceled trip and a family to disappoint.The emotional toll was brutal. My kids were crushed—they’d been counting down the days, and I had to look them in the eyes and explain why we weren’t going. All that planning, all that excitement—wasted. It’s not just upsetting; it’s infuriating. RV Share didn’t care one bit about screwing us over.And here’s the real warning: this isn’t a fluke—it’s how they operate. Dig around online, and you’ll see this is common practice for RV Share. They lure you in with promises of a great trip, take your hard-earned cash, and then cancel at the last second with zero remorse. It’s predatory, plain and simple. People need to know what they’re signing up for with this sham of a company.Do NOT book with RV Share. Save your money, your time, and your sanity. Go with a business that doesn’t treat customers like disposable trash. RV Share is a scam—they don’t deserve a single star, let alone your trust. Avoid them like the plague.",2025-04-08,0

After an hour of calling anyone I could find (they do not make it easy to reach a human!), I was finally told by one of their agents that they had overbooked their vans and had to cancel my reservation, and that I would be refunded the $827.19 I had paid.It is now April 17 and I still have not received my refund. I called their customer service line and after another very long wait, I spoke with someone who claimed my refund had supposedly been issued on April 12. No explanation as to why it took them 2 weeks to do this, assuming they really did it at all. I never received any confirmation of the refund, nor does my credit card statement indicate that the money was refunded. I have filed a formal complaint with my credit card company and hope they can resolve the matter.  This company has already caused me a massive inconvenience; here's hoping it doesn't become a costly one, as well.",2024-03-29,0

EJ Johnson,US,1,AVOID - AVOID - AVOID,"I booked and paid for a 7-passenger minivan a month before I arrived. They told me they would reach out to me with specific directions a few days before I arrived. Never heard from them. On the morning of my flight to LAX, I finally called myself to determine how their process works. It was at THAT time they told me that they had no minivans, but they would put me in a 15 passenger full-sized van.  I didn't want a full size van, but I had no choice since I was already at the airport.  Maybe not a huge deal to drive a bus, but then they charged me MORE for the rental, and also INSISTED I had to buy special insurance because I was now driving a 'commercial vehicle'.  What an absolute scam!  They lied over and over to me, while being disgustingly rude while doing so.

Especially in Atlanta, not having a license plate restricted us from parking in several areas of the city. I also didn't like all the additional fees that I was not made aware of until it was time to check the car out. Had to pay an extra $400-500 dollars without my prior knowledge. Having initially payed for the rental on Priceline, the original price compared to the price after the ridiculous amount of fees was astonishing.  Also didn't like the return process. Had to drop the car off in an Airport garage and just leave the keys and ticket inside. Did not feel comfortable leaving the car unattended like that and not being sure if they were going to be able to find and retrieve the car in a timely manner.",2024-04-02,0

Anand Gm,US,1,DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!!!,"The minute we arrived at Airport Van Rental on June 13th, to pick up our pre-booked van, our vacation plans screeched to a halt.  There was no one there.  We lugged our belongings from our rental car, expecting a quick handover, only to be met with a deserted office and a sinking feeling in my stomach.  Then came the email - the one containing crucial locker access instructions, buried in my spam folder!  Finally, after wrestling with a rusty key and locating the van, after transferring our luggage from our rental car to this van our relief was short-lived.  The engine coughed, sputtered, and died.   Two hours crawling around in the hot Las Vegas sun, with a screaming toddler in tow, trying to contact a company that didn't seem to exist, pushed us to the edge. The road side assistance that we had taken did not work either. We called the number on the back if the key for hours and only heard music.Defeated, we piled back into our friend's car, our dream vacation itinerary replaced by the nightmare of scrambling for extra hotel rooms and a looming Airbnb cancellation fee. We ended up booking 3 rooms in Las Vegas for the night, cancelled our Airbnb at the destination and made a Royal mess of the plans for our rest of our vacation.

I never received any confirmation of the refund, nor does my credit card statement indicate that the money was refunded. I have filed a formal complaint with my credit card company and hope they can resolve the matter.  This company has already caused me a massive inconvenience; here's hoping it doesn't become a costly one, as well.",2024-03-29,0
Aaron Lang,US,1,Horrible,Horrible.  This is by far the worst experience I have ever had at renting a vehicle.   We are trying to transport kids/parents for a robotics competition and have us picking up at the wrong location.    They dont have a van where we are flying into and they won't refund our money!,2024-04-16,0
EJ Johnson,US,1,AVOID - AVOID - AVOID,"I booked and paid for a 7-passenger minivan a month before I arrived. They told me they would reach out to me with specific directions a few days before I arrived. Never heard from them. On the morning of my flight to LAX, I finally called myself to determine how their process works. It was at THAT time they told me that they had no minivans, but they would put me in a 15 passenger full-sized van.  I didn't want a full size van, but I had no choice since I was already at the airport.  Maybe not a huge deal to drive a bus, but then they charged me MORE for the rental, and also INSISTED I had to buy special insurance because I was now driving a 'commercial vehicle'.  What an absolute scam!  They lied over and over to me, while being disgustingly rude while doing so.  Never EVER will I again even think of going back, and I'll share my experience with everyone and anyone!  Rent somewhere else if you wish to work with an honest, polite, and less expensive rental company!",2024-02-11,0
Rufaro,US,1,I didn't like the long process to get…,"I didn't like the long process to get the vehicle. I also didn't like the fact that the rental car did not come with a license plate on the car. Tried to get the company to get me a license plate but they did not. Only emailed me a paper. Especially in Atlanta, not having a license plate restricted us from parking in several areas of the city. I also didn't like all the additional fees that I was not made aware of until it was time to check the car out. Had to pay an extra $400-500 dollars without my prior knowledge. Having initially payed for the rental on Priceline, the original price compared to the price after the ridiculous amount of fees was astonishing.  Also didn't like the return process. Had to drop the car off in an Airport garage and just leave the keys and ticket inside. Did not feel comfortable leaving the car unattended like that and not being sure if they were going to be able to find and retrieve the car in a timely manner.",2024-04-02,0
Scott Ames-Messinger,US,1,CANCELED A PREPAID BOOKING A WEEK BEFORE OUR TRIP,"A WEEK before our trip to Austin, Texas, Airport Van Rental CANCELED OUR VAN that WE HAD PREPAID.When I called, I was told they'd call back and they never did. Later, I called back and was on hold for 40 minutes. The next day, I called back and was directed to someone who was not the manager. This person refused to transfer me to the manager, Tupou Fifita.They did not try to secure another van. They did not move a van from another location. They did not connect us with another rental agency. They did *absolutely nothing* to try to fix things.We have 9 people and all the airport cars have been sold out in Austin for 2 MONTHS. There's simply not other airport options. I have no idea how our trip will continue given how incompetent and unhelpful they are.",2024-03-29,0
Heather Nolan,US,1,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - DO NOT USE!,"Terrible customer service.  Impossible to reach an actual person.  Hours of operation are not clear.  I do not recommend this company.The details:  Our connecting flight was delayed which made us a day late for our rental.  I tried calling the company to make sure we would still have our rental the following morning when we were due to arrive.  I left a voicemail since there wasn't anyone to answer the phone.  The next morning, I called first thing and also received the option to leave a message.  Since I had done that the night before, I opted to send an email to make sure we had something in writing.  At this point I was getting nervous that we wouldn't have a vehicle upon arrival.  I called back a few times and was advised by the recording that there was ""1"" caller ahead of us.  Finally, I thought - I would have a chance to speak with a real person and explain our situation and  hopefully confirm our rental.  After 55 minutes of holding (I have the screen shots!) I finally decided to rent with a different company.  We paid much more than we needed to but we were stuck at that point.  After a 10 day family vacation I forgot about the experience until we got home and I was catching up on emails and found the confirmation from them.  There was never a call back or a return email from my attempts to reach them over 10 days ago. All that to say - I can not recommend this company.  If I ever hear from them and there is an explanation to all of this madness, I am willing to update my review at that time.",2024-03-15,0
Angy Customer,CA,1,The most horrible experience ever,Car reserved was not ready. Had to wait an hour. Finally offered us a car that was less than adequate.

Madalina Verdes,DK,1,Wizz Air’s 24-Hour Cancellation Policy is misleading,"Wizz Air’s 24-Hour Cancellation Policy Is Misleading - I Ended Up Paying Twice for One FlightI’ve been flying with Wizz Air more than 15 times a year, and when you count the tickets I book for my family, it’s over 20 flights annually. I know the system, I respect their policies, but this time Wizz Air let me down completely.I accidentally reversed the departure and arrival cities on a booking and realized the mistake within just a few hours. I tried to cancel or change it immediately, and I was shocked.Their system only offered 334 RON back out of 1,620 RON. They kept over 95% of the ticket value. Their so-called “24-hour cancellation policy” is misleading and doesn’t protect honest mistakes.I had no choice but to pay a change fee of 848 RON, plus a fare difference, which brought me to paying almost double the cost of a normal ticket. I paid nearly the same amount again just to fly the route I originally meant to book.I contacted customer service, explained the situation, emphasized my loyalty, but they didn’t care. It felt like talking to a wall. I understand that the employees in customer support can only do so much and need to be backed by the right internal policies and clauses. But that’s exactly the issue: the company gives them no room to support loyal passengers, even when it’s clearly a minor and honest mistake.Wizz Air’s rules show zero flexibility or goodwill, even for frequent flyers. It’s not just about this one mistake, it’s about how a company treats its loyal customers when something small goes wrong.So be warned: Wizz Air will charge you for your ticket twice if you make a mistake, even if you notice it immediately. And they won’t care how many times you fly with them. There’s no loyalty. No fairness. Just profit.",2025-05-17,0

We checked in early, chose our seats, and got the boarding passes. Then, on the day of departure, we get an email that they allocated us different seats due to some change of airplane.

Madalina Verdes,DK,1,Wizz Air’s 24-Hour Cancellation Policy is misleading,"Wizz Air’s 24-Hour Cancellation Policy Is Misleading - I Ended Up Paying Twice for One FlightI’ve been flying with Wizz Air more than 15 times a year, and when you count the tickets I book for my family, it’s over 20 flights annually. I know the system, I respect their policies, but this time Wizz Air let me down completely.I accidentally reversed the departure and arrival cities on a booking and realized the mistake within just a few hours. I tried to cancel or change it immediately, and I was shocked.Their system only offered 334 RON back out of 1,620 RON. They kept over 95% of the ticket value. Their so-called “24-hour cancellation policy” is misleading and doesn’t protect honest mistakes.I had no choice but to pay a change fee of 848 RON, plus a fare difference, which brought me to paying almost double the cost of a normal ticket. I paid nearly the same amount again just to fly the route I originally meant to book.I contacted customer service, explained the situation, emphasized my loyalty, but they didn’t care. It felt like talking to a wall. I understand that the employees in customer support can only do so much and need to be backed by the right internal policies and clauses. But that’s exactly the issue: the company gives them no room to support loyal passengers, even when it’s clearly a minor and honest mistake.Wizz Air’s rules show zero flexibility or goodwill, even for frequent flyers. It’s not just about this one mistake, it’s about how a company treats its loyal customers when something small goes wrong.So be warned: Wizz Air will charge you for your ticket twice if you make a mistake, even if you notice it immediately. And they won’t care how many times you fly with them. There’s no loyalty. No fairness. Just profit.",2025-05-17,0

They even provided a sample of local coffee and honey.                         Cons: 1) lake dock is in disrepair (not the owner’s fault but could be a safety issue for guests) 2) deck chairs and kayaks were very dirty 3) Primary bed mattress was worn and dips to the middle, the extra pillows did not have removable washable  covers  4) no washer or dryer for your wet lake clothes 5) rustic in looks - lots of cobwebs 6) required to hand wash, dry and put away dishes at check out- not a big deal but relying on guest led to our discovery of dirty dishes in the cabinets so we had to wash prior to use For any Wyndham Reward users - IMO this is only worth teir 2 IF this is your desired location",2025-05-10,1

Family of Six,US,4,Honest review of Lake Sutherland,"Honest review of Lake Sutherland. Pros: 1)super easy in and out- road right off 101, with level parking and entrance with no steps, easy access to the lake 2)view is great from the deck 3) easy/close entry onto the lake 4) kayaks with paddles and life jackets, fishing poles and board/card games provided 5) 3 queen beds with extra pillows and blankets 6) a walk in shower with plenty of extra towels 7) well appointed kitchen (no full size oven but a good sized toaster oven.  They even provided a sample of local coffee and honey.                         Cons: 1) lake dock is in disrepair (not the owner’s fault but could be a safety issue for guests) 2) deck chairs and kayaks were very dirty 3) Primary bed mattress was worn and dips to the middle, the extra pillows did not have removable washable  covers  4) no washer or dryer for your wet lake clothes 5) rustic in looks - lots of cobwebs 6) required to hand wash, dry and put away dishes at check out- not a big deal but relying on guest led to our discovery of dirty dishes in the cabinets so we had to wash prior to use For any Wyndham Reward users - IMO this is only worth teir 2 IF this is your desired location",2025-05-10,1

Jae,US,1,Scummy company that robs its customers,"Don't take OurBus if you think there's any chance of you having to cancel your bus. In 2019 I had to cancel a couple tickets for another passenger not being able to go due to a family emergency. Instead of a refund, OurBus gives you credits for future bus rides. Okay, other public transportation services give out full refunds so not ideal, but fine. When the credits were issued to me they stated that their policy was the credits DO NOT ever expire. I figured I'd use their services again in the future and kept tab of my credits.Fast forward to this week. I finally had a reason to take the bus again and went to use my credits. Surprise, surprise-- they were gone. I thought it must have been a mistake in my account and reached out to customer service, only to be told that their policy changed and that credits are only valid for 5 years after being issued. Despite the policy being different when I was given my credits, they refused to grandfather me in or give back any of my $100 worth of credits. Wouldn't even extend the expiration date to 5 years from when the policy changed. Would not budge or work with me at all despite me being a regular customer in the past.So basically I had $100 stolen from me. No services rendered, no refund given, and no credits to be seen. Not sure who was in charge of this terrible policy, but it definitely ensured that I will never ever be using OurBus again. I'd warn others about their scummy policy so they don't leave other customers high and dry.Edited to add: read the company's reply below for exhibit A. Don't be shocked if they suddenly change their new 5 year policy to be even shorter at the end of the 4th year so they can just pocket your money without providing their service. Clearly if I had known OurBus would not honor its policy I would have just filed a chargeback on my card while I could. Buyer beware: there is zero reason to trust this company or its word.",2025-05-13,1

Romina,US,2,Disappointed with Super Saver Pass and lack of support,"I bought the Super Saver Pass from OurBus expecting consistent savings, but the way it’s handled is frustrating and unclear. While it gave me a $15 discount per ticket as promised, I had to reschedule two trips — and each time, the system deducted an additional $15 from my pass for the rescheduled ride. That means I lost four credits for only two trips.I contacted customer support twice to ask for the lost credits to be restored. Both times I was told they couldn’t help me due to a “system limitation.” It feels like a policy loophole that punishes passengers for making changes — which are sometimes unavoidable.This experience makes the Super Saver Pass feel misleading and not worth the investment if plans aren’t 100% fixed. It’s disappointing that OurBus wouldn’t make this right despite reaching out politely.I’m giving 2 stars because the buses themselves are in general fine and the pass did initially work. But I’ll gladly update this review if OurBus addresses the issue and restores the lost credits.Thank you for your reply, OurBus. I have reached out again recently, as per your suggestion, and contacted you directly. However, I’ve been informed that no resolution can be provided due to system limitations. I’ve lost $30 in credits because of unavoidable rescheduling, and this still feels unjust. As a loyal customer, I understand the need for policies, but I believe there should be more flexibility in cases like mine.You mentioned that my feedback has been shared with the team, but despite this, I have yet to receive a meaningful resolution. I am hopeful that OurBus will reconsider my case and find a fair solution moving forward. Thank you.",2025-04-17,1

Jae,US,1,Scummy company that robs its customers,"Don't take OurBus if you think there's any chance of you having to cancel your bus. In 2019 I had to cancel a couple tickets for another passenger not being able to go due to a family emergency. Instead of a refund, OurBus gives you credits for future bus rides. Okay, other public transportation services give out full refunds so not ideal, but fine. When the credits were issued to me they stated that their policy was the credits DO NOT ever expire. I figured I'd use their services again in the future and kept tab of my credits.Fast forward to this week. I finally had a reason to take the bus again and went to use my credits. Surprise, surprise-- they were gone. I thought it must have been a mistake in my account and reached out to customer service, only to be told that their policy changed and that credits are only valid for 5 years after being issued. Despite the policy being different when I was given my credits, they refused to grandfather me in or give back any of my $100 worth of credits. Wouldn't even extend the expiration date to 5 years from when the policy changed. Would not budge or work with me at all despite me being a regular customer in the past.So basically I had $100 stolen from me. No services rendered, no refund given, and no credits to be seen. Not sure who was in charge of this terrible policy, but it definitely ensured that I will never ever be using OurBus again. I'd warn others about their scummy policy so they don't leave other customers high and dry.Edited to add: read the company's reply below for exhibit A. Don't be shocked if they suddenly change their new 5 year policy to be even shorter at the end of the 4th year so they can just pocket your money without providing their service. Clearly if I had known OurBus would not honor its policy I would have just filed a chargeback on my card while I could.

Romina,US,2,Disappointed with Super Saver Pass and lack of support,"I bought the Super Saver Pass from OurBus expecting consistent savings, but the way it’s handled is frustrating and unclear. While it gave me a $15 discount per ticket as promised, I had to reschedule two trips — and each time, the system deducted an additional $15 from my pass for the rescheduled ride. That means I lost four credits for only two trips.I contacted customer support twice to ask for the lost credits to be restored. Both times I was told they couldn’t help me due to a “system limitation.” It feels like a policy loophole that punishes passengers for making changes — which are sometimes unavoidable.This experience makes the Super Saver Pass feel misleading and not worth the investment if plans aren’t 100% fixed. It’s disappointing that OurBus wouldn’t make this right despite reaching out politely.I’m giving 2 stars because the buses themselves are in general fine and the pass did initially work. But I’ll gladly update this review if OurBus addresses the issue and restores the lost credits.Thank you for your reply, OurBus. I have reached out again recently, as per your suggestion, and contacted you directly. However, I’ve been informed that no resolution can be provided due to system limitations.

But I think people mistake the services of Cardelmar which only is to provide a voucher with a cheaper fare to any rental car company they deal with and an insurance to cover the franchise in case of damages to the vehicle, and the car rental company itself. If I'll be late to pick up the car I assume I have to make contact with the rental car company, their phone number is written in the voucher. By instinct if I'm presented with a company I don't know, I will check the reviews on the internet or rent from the major ones where I know they will be professional. Cardelmar stipulate on their contract that any extra insurance fee from the rental car company can be declined because they cover the insurance part. The one company you need to be careful of is the rental car company itself, and avoid the ones you don't know. I have been using their service for 3 years, 2 times renting a car in the Netherlands, one in Spain and one in Sicily. In Sicily, someone through a ball or kicked the side of the car and left a dent, and driving the awful roads full of holes and bumps of Sicily damaged the tires and the wheels. Well, when we gave the car back, the agent of Locautorent who is the intermediary for Alamo pounced at the wheels first and said they were considerably damaged, it was like he knew right away where the car would be hit. after a useless argument that one would consider it is the normal use of the car in that part of the country, with the dent on the side, they charged me 980€. I was really thinking that if some other car rental company would try to make me pay more than the voucher, Locautorent found the good way to make you pay much more. It was like being cheated and helpless. Back home I called Cardelmar and the lady on the phone said they knew locautorent was known for this practice. She also said I was fully covered with the insurance I took with them and after sending all the appropriate papers, I should get a refund. All of this happened on Sept. 20, 2020. I received an email yesterday saying that everything was OK and I'll get the refund within 21 days. To conclude, to my knowledge Cardelmar are good and competitive, and they do their job providing a better rate than directly with the car rental company.

At the pickup it turned out that the car was not with winter tyres as booked. I called the billiger-mietwagen and the customer service assured me that once back we can claim the difference. It took me a month and numerous emails with the arrogant cardelmar staff, where initially they claimed that they had not offered winter tyres and later on claimed that the provider on site was not obliged to provide the winter tyres!!! But this was the reason to pay more than double.If I could give negativ stars, I would gladly do that.I recommend highly to stay away from these arrogant frauds.They only collect cash and rely only that no one will start any legal actions, since they will cost much more than the claims.Horrible experience and I assure you - never ever again!",2020-01-06,0

Kerep Yaman,DE,1,Never CarDelMar - Never Goldcar,"We had booked a rental car for their Madeira vacation with the agency CarDelMar. The price for 10 days including fully comprehensive insurance was around 400 €, which was deducted by CarDelMar.The car rental site was Goldcar. When we wanted to pick up the car in Funchal at the airport, they were asked by the local car rental company Goldcar an additional bill in the amount of 431 € on additional insurance. We refused the payment, whereupon the car rental employee said ""no payment, no car"".We will then contact CalDelMar Customer Service. He says additional costs would be reimbursed by CarDelMar in these circumstances, we should pay everything and enjoy the holiday.Back in Germany, we opened a transaction at CardelMar and reclaimed the amount of 431 €. The customer service has demanded several proofs and documents at intervals. Lastly, a written confirmation from the bank with signature and stamp that the presented credit card is a valid, full credit card (no prepaid, charge or debit card). At the time of renting, there was a sufficient disposition.When this confirmation was also presented by the Bank, CarDelMar refused to reimburse the additional costs after three months (!), Claiming that the said on-site payments were voluntary and therefore not eligible for reimbursement.We feel betrayed and ripped off by CardelMar and will proceed after legal review of this online intermediary.",2019-11-18,0

But I think people mistake the services of Cardelmar which only is to provide a voucher with a cheaper fare to any rental car company they deal with and an insurance to cover the franchise in case of damages to the vehicle, and the car rental company itself. If I'll be late to pick up the car I assume I have to make contact with the rental car company, their phone number is written in the voucher. By instinct if I'm presented with a company I don't know, I will check the reviews on the internet or rent from the major ones where I know they will be professional. Cardelmar stipulate on their contract that any extra insurance fee from the rental car company can be declined because they cover the insurance part. The one company you need to be careful of is the rental car company itself, and avoid the ones you don't know. I have been using their service for 3 years, 2 times renting a car in the Netherlands, one in Spain and one in Sicily. In Sicily, someone through a ball or kicked the side of the car and left a dent, and driving the awful roads full of holes and bumps of Sicily damaged the tires and the wheels. Well, when we gave the car back, the agent of Locautorent who is the intermediary for Alamo pounced at the wheels first and said they were considerably damaged, it was like he knew right away where the car would be hit. after a useless argument that one would consider it is the normal use of the car in that part of the country, with the dent on the side, they charged me 980€. I was really thinking that if some other car rental company would try to make me pay more than the voucher, Locautorent found the good way to make you pay much more. It was like being cheated and helpless. Back home I called Cardelmar and the lady on the phone said they knew locautorent was known for this practice. She also said I was fully covered with the insurance I took with them and after sending all the appropriate papers, I should get a refund. All of this happened on Sept. 20, 2020. I received an email yesterday saying that everything was OK and I'll get the refund within 21 days. To conclude, to my knowledge Cardelmar are good and competitive, and they do their job providing a better rate than directly with the car rental company.

Robyn Perlman,US,5,Another Point of View is an awesome…,"Another Point of View is an awesome location close to Boone.  The cabin is newer and nice to have separate AC units on all floors.  Loved having a deck on each floor to enjoy the outside mountain air.   Loved having a pool table on bottom level, would be a nice added touch to put a beer/soda fridge on bottom level for the fire pit and pool table.  After arriving and walking around the cabin we realized the floor was filthy.  Our feet were black within minutes.  You could see a layer of dust on the floor in the sun.  Alot of people like to use 2 towels after a shower and we were only offered 1 per person. After showering it would have been nice to have a rug or towel to step on because the floor gets cold and slippery.  The ice machine and water in the fridge didnt work so we relied on having to buy bottled water for our drinking needs.  I know we are in a mountain cabin and everyone’s sleep schedules are different, light filtering curtains would add a nice touch.   A couple throw blankets for the couch would be amazing for the cooler winter days.  But overall was an amazing experience.",2025-05-08,1

Even during the longer drives between destinations, she kept us entertained with engaging stories and historical insights. The driver was equally impressive, navigating both city streets and long countryside roads with ease and professionalism.Now, about the trip itself. When I first read the tour description covering England, Ireland, and Scotland, I assumed there wouldn’t be much to learn and that it might feel a bit dull—but that was a big mistake. London turned out to be fantastic, Ireland was full of charming towns and beautiful scenery, and Scotland was simply wonderful. Edinburgh, in particular, stood out with its vibrant atmosphere and two-night stay, which gave us plenty of time to explore its many attractions.All in all, it was an excellent trip with pleasant weather, unforgettable experiences, and lasting memories across three incredible countries.

The host were knowledgeable, efficient, resourceful, and tailored each day to the two of us and our interests.  We saw highlights of Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, Kyoto, ZNara, Hiroshima, Osaka and Armani.  We added on a day to go to Disney Tokyo!!  We fed snow monkeys and the bowing deer in Nara.  We saw beautiful flowers in bloom and witnessed the cleanest and safest country we have visited in our 30 years of traveling to more than 25 countries.

Even during the longer drives between destinations, she kept us entertained with engaging stories and historical insights. The driver was equally impressive, navigating both city streets and long countryside roads with ease and professionalism.Now, about the trip itself. When I first read the tour description covering England, Ireland, and Scotland, I assumed there wouldn’t be much to learn and that it might feel a bit dull—but that was a big mistake. London turned out to be fantastic, Ireland was full of charming towns and beautiful scenery, and Scotland was simply wonderful. Edinburgh, in particular, stood out with its vibrant atmosphere and two-night stay, which gave us plenty of time to explore its many attractions.All in all, it was an excellent trip with pleasant weather, unforgettable experiences, and lasting memories across three incredible countries.

rnair11,US,3,"Great place, great shuttle service: Bad experience with ATTENDANT","This place is great for parking and the shuttle service is also great. However, I have run into issues with one of the attendants while checking out. I have been using On Air Parking website to reserve spots as I fly every week from Oakland airport. 6 weeks back, when I first went to the spot I tried to get help from the attendant as to what I should do as I have a reservation from a third party. He said, I should pull a ticket, park and then when I check out, it will be settled. I continued following his said instructions.That week it went ok while checking out on the following Tuesday.The following week, it was a different attendant. This person did not ask me any questions, just took my ticket, copied my reservation number and let me go.Since the week of Dec 4th, I have having to deal with the first attendant and he has been giving me a hard time. On the 8th, he said that my reservation is not visible. Luckily, I had another reservation and that worked (but that was for the week of 11th)Now on the week of 11th to 14th, the same attendant again said that my reservation does not pop up and I tried to call On Air Parking to resolve it. But it was 8 pm PST and they had closed. However, the attendant found my reservation some how and helped me solve the issue. This attendant told me that I should not mix up reservations, which did not make sense as the reservations are for particular dates. I had tried my best to be patient all this time as no matter what, I had a reservation from a third party which is authorized by this facility. So as far as I give the receipt, I should be free to go.Today, I had a the same issue again and with the same attendant. He started telling me that my reservation does not pop up. I tried to tell him, in any case I have the receipt, why not just use that. He just would not accept it. I completely lost my cool and did start yelling at him, especially because he asked me to pay the full charge. I ended up pay $47.98, even though I had a reservation paid in full.In the midst of the argument, this attendant mentioned that if my reservation was good then why did I have to pull a ticket and not scan my reservation. AND this is where I lost my cool even further. Going back 6 weeks - this is the same attendant from whom I tried to get directions onw what I need to do when parking with a reservation. HE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID, PULL A TICKET AND IT WILL BE SETTELED ON THE WAY OUT.Seriously, I never had to break my head anywhere when I had a reservation.

rnair11,US,3,"Great place, great shuttle service: Bad experience with ATTENDANT","This place is great for parking and the shuttle service is also great. However, I have run into issues with one of the attendants while checking out. I have been using On Air Parking website to reserve spots as I fly every week from Oakland airport. 6 weeks back, when I first went to the spot I tried to get help from the attendant as to what I should do as I have a reservation from a third party. He said, I should pull a ticket, park and then when I check out, it will be settled. I continued following his said instructions.That week it went ok while checking out on the following Tuesday.The following week, it was a different attendant. This person did not ask me any questions, just took my ticket, copied my reservation number and let me go.Since the week of Dec 4th, I have having to deal with the first attendant and he has been giving me a hard time. On the 8th, he said that my reservation is not visible. Luckily, I had another reservation and that worked (but that was for the week of 11th)Now on the week of 11th to 14th, the same attendant again said that my reservation does not pop up and I tried to call On Air Parking to resolve it. But it was 8 pm PST and they had closed. However, the attendant found my reservation some how and helped me solve the issue. This attendant told me that I should not mix up reservations, which did not make sense as the reservations are for particular dates. I had tried my best to be patient all this time as no matter what, I had a reservation from a third party which is authorized by this facility. So as far as I give the receipt, I should be free to go.Today, I had a the same issue again and with the same attendant. He started telling me that my reservation does not pop up. I tried to tell him, in any case I have the receipt, why not just use that. He just would not accept it. I completely lost my cool and did start yelling at him, especially because he asked me to pay the full charge. I ended up pay $47.98, even though I had a reservation paid in full.In the midst of the argument, this attendant mentioned that if my reservation was good then why did I have to pull a ticket and not scan my reservation. AND this is where I lost my cool even further. Going back 6 weeks - this is the same attendant from whom I tried to get directions onw what I need to do when parking with a reservation. HE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID, PULL A TICKET AND IT WILL BE SETTELED ON THE WAY OUT.Seriously, I never had to break my head anywhere when I had a reservation.

Liezel Deguinon,CA,1,To whom it may concern my name is…,"To whom it may concern my name is Liezel DeguinonI just wanted to share my story flying with Cheap Air, since it was a worth story to tell, my frustration and disappointments lingering and must sit at my computer to write.I booked a flight through Cheap Air Flying Vancouver to Manila, Manila to General Santos City (Philippines Airlines) Last February 28, 2025, Booking reference #86599991, Cheap Air had moved the time of the original flight from Manila to General Santos City, I phone them and says I won’t be able to fly that Manila to General Santos City (April 2, 2025)since will be arrived Manila 5:30 Am and the flight to General Santos city move to 4 pm, I was clear that I won't take that flight, they did not inform me that if I no show It will affect my flight back, It frustrate me to think that I had spoken with them in the phone clearly that I won’t be able to take that flight and they say nothing about it will affect my flight back, why, because they want to make money and make my life miserable nobody seems to care nobody inform me emails or calls that my flight back in cancelled, considering I’m on my vacation.March 27, 2025, we all packed to go and tried to check in online only to find out that my flight is cancelled, calling Philippines Airline, Cheap Air put me on hold from 12:Am to 5:30 am in the morning trying to figure out whats going on, very unprofessional don’t know how to deal with customer hang up on me many times, what I don’t understand is I told them I won’t be able to flight that manila to general Santos city since they move the flight and now they cancelled my flight back that I already paid for it, and now they told me to book a flight back.Long story short, I had to purchase a ticket back which was the cheapest for the 3 of us $4674.6 and they couldn’t find a flight back the next day so we had to wait till April 3, 2025, extended my stay 5 days spending money with hotels, figured out where to stay since our check out is next day, and missing the day of work, these people no idea what we been through and flying with a small child.I can’t express enough my frustration, I try to let it go and forget about it but I have to do something about it, so in total round trip from Vancouver to General Santos city we spent $10,000, re buy a ticket back when it’s not my fault, as a customer I should get my money back since it’s not my fault and changing hour of flight when its not my fault and we have schedules to make we should get compensated. This is the worst flight of my life, I hope everyone wears my shoes.and understand where it's coming from, I was not able to sleep that night not to mention spending a lot of money for something it’s not my fault. The Airline rules are very unacceptable if no show they will cancel your flight that you already paid for, tell me if that makes sense.All in all, I just want to share my story and hope that it won’t happen to anyone.",2025-04-28,0
